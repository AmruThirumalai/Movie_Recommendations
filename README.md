## Objectives

* Explore and analyze movie ratings data
* Identify trends in genres, ratings, and popularity
* Build a simple movie-to-movie recommendation system
* Visualize and clearly explain insights from the data

---

## Dataset

* **MovieLens Dataset (100k)**
* Includes movie metadata, user ratings, and timestamps

---

## Tools & Technologies

* Python
* pandas, numpy
* matplotlib, seaborn
* scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

## Methodology

1. Load and clean the dataset
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Visualize trends and patterns in ratings and genres
4. Create a user–movie ratings matrix
5. Use cosine similarity to recommend similar movies

---

## Results

* Insights into rating behavior and genre popularity
* Visualizations highlighting trends in the data
* A working recommendation function that suggests similar movies

---

## Future Improvements

* User-based collaborative filtering
* Content-based recommendations
* Model evaluation metrics
* Interactive web application
